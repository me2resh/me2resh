I am a software Craftsman, tech lead, pursuer of value and quality.

With over 15 years of engineering experience with a proven track record of designing high throughput applications, I focus on domain- driven design, cloud-native solutions, event-driven architectures, and Serverless architecture design patterns.

I have been writing software professionally since 2004, and leading teams since 2009, at startups, and well-established companies.
