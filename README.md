# Hello!

I am a software craftsman, tech lead, and relentless pursuer of value and quality.

With over 18 years of engineering experience and a proven track record of designing high-throughput applications, my expertise lies in domain-driven design, cloud-native solutions, event-driven architectures, and serverless architecture design patterns.

I've been writing software professionally since 2004 and leading teams since 2009 at both startups and well-established companies. My recent experience includes working as a Senior Solutions Architect at Zavamed, Systems Architect at TimeDoctor, and Tech Lead/Co-founder at camelCaseTech.

My passion lies in designing solutions and architectures for business domains that make a difference in people's lives and tackle challenging technology problems.
